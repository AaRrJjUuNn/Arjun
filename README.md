* Just a collection of random Python Projects/ Code 
* Almost like a coding journey
* I would like to develop a small game one day - obviously not with python lol
* Code is generally of my own creation and experimentation ( it might not be the most efficient, but thats why im here: to learn.)
* age 16, as of making this entry.
